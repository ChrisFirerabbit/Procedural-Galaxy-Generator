# 🌌 Procedural-Galaxy-Generator

Multi-threaded procedural coordinate generation based off of galaxy formations.

## 📄 Info

This project was used to help familiarize myself with rust.  Futher planned development included a 3D multiplayer environment.  However in its current iteration, it only supports generating coordinates which is thereby printed to the standard output.

## 🔧 Build

```
cargo build
```

## 💻 Usage

```
cargo run --bin server
```
